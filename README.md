# screen_time_and_out_time

# Project Idea

## Description
In this project, I will collect and analyze data on my phone screen time and the amount of time I spend outdoors, investigating how these factors influence each other. I will enrich the research by collecting extra data, such as the time i spend in nature or the time i spend in social media.
## Purpose
I have been complaining about my excessive phone usage and i am aware that it has bad effects on my life, therefore i have an idea to deal with this problem.
My hypothesis is that increased time spent outdoors(especially in nature) will significantly reduce my daily phone screen time. Therefore, i aim to collect sufficient and precise data to get a satisfying result leading to modifications in my lifestyle.
